# README

*Disclaimer* - I made this app quickly & for fun, many things can be improved! I wanted to build the bulk and then write some specs if I had time.

* Ruby version - 3.1.2
* Rails version - 7.0.4

Runs like any simple rails app with devise authentication :-)


Stuff I'd like to add:
* More types of posts and some kind of filtering
* Comment threads
* Comment likes (or reactions?)
* Better specs
